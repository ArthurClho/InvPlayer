# InvPlayer

This project is abandoned/archived for now. It was supposed to be a gtk client
for invidious but I kept running into weird stutters that I have no idea how
to even start debugging, these are probably caused by the embedded mpv player,
that's as far as I've got before deciding this wasn't worth it. Doing this 
properly will require a lot more knowledge about GTK than I want to have.
